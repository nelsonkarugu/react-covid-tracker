# react-covid-tracker
1. This is a personal project that i worked on after graduating high school.
2. This react app pulls data from a worldwide Covid-19 public API and basically renders it out as a website.
3. I haven't added a lot of stying in this project but I am planning on doing so later :).

You can access the current web version of this app at https://covid-tracker-22b4a.web.app/.
